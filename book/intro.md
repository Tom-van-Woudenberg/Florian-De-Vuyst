# Welcome to this TeachBook

This book demonstrates how to use our Sphinx-Thebe extension to run python in the browser (no Binder or other server required) in a JupyterBook.

The code in this book can be used interactively: click {fa}`rocket` --> {guilabel}`Live Code` in the top right corner on one of the other pages, then wait until the message {guilabel}`Python interaction ready!` appears.
